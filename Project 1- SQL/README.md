### Date created:

### Description:
The Sakila movie database is a SQL database of online DVD rentals. In this project, you will use SQL to explore this database and provide interesting questions, the corresponding answers and proper visualizations.

There are two main components to this project:
* The query component
* The presentation component

For the query component, the student has to create four interesting questions regarding the database, and they must be within the given rubrics:
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit JOINs.
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more aggregations.
* At least 2 of the 4 SQL queries need to include either a subquery OR a CTE.
* At least 1 of the 4 queries should use a Window Function.

For the presentation component, the student had to create four slides, and each should have:
* A question of interest.
* A supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
* A supporting visualization, including a title and axis label, created using the final data of the SQL queries that answer the questions of interest.
* A small summary on each slide

### List of software, firmware, hardware and database you may require:
* Installing PostgreSQL for Windows: http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/install-postgresql/
* Installing PostgreSQL for Mac OS : https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/
* You will need to download the Movie database from this page: [PostgreSQL Sample Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/)
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
