## Project 1: Investigate a Relational Database



### Overview:

The Sakila movie database is a SQL database of online DVD rentals. In this project, you will use SQL to explore this database and provide interesting questions, the corresponding answers and proper visualizations.

There are two main components to this project:
* The query component
* The presentation component

For the query component, the student has to create four interesting questions regarding the database, and they must be within the given rubrics:
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit JOINs.
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more aggregations.
* At least 2 of the 4 SQL queries need to include either a subquery OR a CTE.
* At least 1 of the 4 queries should use a Window Function.

For the presentation component, the student had to create four slides, and each should have:
* A question of interest.
* A supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
* A supporting visualization, including a title and axis label, created using the final data of the SQL queries that answer the questions of interest.
* A small summary on each slide

## Project 2: Explore US Bikeshare Data




### Overview:

Use Python to understand U.S. bikeshare data . Calculate statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filter for the dataset to analyze.

To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
* Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda.
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

Data will be provided in three city dataset files, namely:
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

## Project 3: Post Your Work On Github



### Overview:

In this project, you'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor your previous BikeShare project using Git.

The Project Submission consists of the filling of a template with all the Git commands used to perform the requested tasks.
